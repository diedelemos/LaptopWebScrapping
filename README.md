# LaptopWebScrapping
Web Scrapping Project for buying laptops in Spain:

Buying a new laptop either for personal use, work or gaming is a tedious process due to the amount of pages, promotions and options that are getting bigger and bigger. 
Within Spain there are several online stores that allow greater flexibility and ease of purchase but are still many options, so for this project I decided to scrape the information and prices of the best selling computers in the most used stores within the country to compare them and reach a decision in a faster way. Within the scraped data we will be able to filter the options to get to the best priced laptop for our requirements.

I have decided to use the following stores:
- MediaMarkt: Share of visits = 21.43%. 
- Pc Components: Share of visits = 14,78%.
- Worten: Share of visits = 5,63%.
- PhoneHouse = Share of visits = 4.58
- Back Market = Share of visits 1,56%.

With these options we would be scraping about 50% of the most visited sites for the purchase of laptops in Spain.
This data extracted from the pages will then be stored and can be used for a Machine Learning model.
